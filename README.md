# Train-Timetable
Timetable project for class, using Firebase as a database.

A simple train timetable that uses a database to keep track of various trains, their next arrival times, and frequency.

This project is admittedly a big mess, I misread / misremembered the instructions and therefore didn't implement a third of the functionality that was asked for... I implemented moment.js but never ended up using it, and didn't have displays for the next train in minutes. Also there was no logic written for form handling, which is bad-news-bears and results in things like words appearing in number-fields or absurdly large numbers being supplied.

All that aside I'm rather happy with the existing functionality. Users can create new trains, and the Firebase database runs flawlessly. I plan on revisiting this project at a later date to properly implement moment.js and missing prerequisites like next arrival time.
